### Create a branch ###

where to try out new ideas and don't affect the *master* branch

### Add commits ###

keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch

create a transparent history that others can follow to understand what you've done and why

commit message : a description explaining why a particular change was made

initiating discussion about your commits.

anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request(because they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository)

### Deploy ###
![4](https://github.com/Eric-Zhang-C/front-end-practice/blob/git-workflow/4.png)
deploy your changes to verify them in production

### Merge ###

Now changes have been verified in production, it is time to merge code into the master branch.

Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to code.
